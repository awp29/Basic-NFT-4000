# Basic-NFT-4000

This is a prototype Dapp that I have built to help me learn Blockchain/Ethereum/Web3.
This is definitely not a production App, there is still tons to add i.e proper error handling etc

A live version of the Dapp can be found here https://cold-thunder-6759.on.fleek.co/

* To use the app MetaMask must be installed
* Goerli is the only supported network
